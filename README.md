# Hardhat Hackathon Boilerplate

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and `frontend` directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. 

Before you can get everything working, you need to setup Metamask to have Hardhat as a network.
1. Make sure Metamask is installed in your browser of choice.
2. In Metamask, Add the Hardhat network: 
```
Account icon -> Settings -> Network -> Add Network

```
3. Enter:
```
Network Name - Hardhat (Localhost 8545)
New RPC Url - http://localhost:8545
Chain ID - 31337
Currency Symbol - ETH
```

Now, if you navigate to the running app at localhost:3000, you should be able to connect your wallet.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using this repository and many tips in [its documentation](https://hardhat.org/tutorial).

For a complete introduction to Hardhat, refer to [this guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## What???s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a Dapp powered by Hardhat and React.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): An Ethereum development task runner and testing network.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): A JavaScript test runner.
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): A JavaScript assertion library.
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/): A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/): To have Ethereum-specific Chai assertions/mathers.
- [A sample frontend/Dapp](./frontend): A Dapp which uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Reset Account`.
